# plotting_tool
I did this project in 2017 to plot graphs 

This is the final version of the program. To plot new functions you need to modify the program and compile it. I was young so do not expect much from this project.

Here are some examples:
First example displays graphs:
* ![#fa240c](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fa240c/000000?text=+) y = sin(x)
* ![#86fc17](https://via.placeholder.com/15/86fc17/000000?text=+) y = 1/2 * sin(x + Ï€/4)

Second example displays graphs:
 * ![#e031d5](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e031d5/000000?text=+) y = -sin(x)
 * ![#e031d5](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e031d5/000000?text=+) y = -tan(x)
 * ![#86fc17](https://via.placeholder.com/15/86fc17/000000?text=+) y = cos(x)
 * ![#8c520f](https://via.placeholder.com/15/8c520f/000000?text=+) y = -cos(x)
